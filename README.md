# terraform-aws-iam-s3-user [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access S3 resources, e.g. to give the user read/write/delete access to the objects in an S3 bucket.

Suitable for CI/CD systems (_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI, CodeFresh) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).

## Usage

This example will create an IAM user and allow read access to all objects in the S3 bucket `examplebucket`


```hcl
module "s3_user" {
  source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user.git?ref=master"
  namespace    = "cp"
  stage        = "prod"
  name         = "app"
  s3_actions   = ["s3:GetObject"]
  s3_resources = "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
}
```
