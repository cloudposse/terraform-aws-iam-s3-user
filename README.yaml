# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to provision a basic IAM user with permissions to access S3 resources, e.g. to give the user read/write/delete access to the objects in an S3 bucket.

  Suitable for CI/CD systems (_e.g._ TravisCI, CircleCI, CodeFresh) or systems which are *external* to AWS that cannot leverage [AWS IAM Instance Profiles](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_switch-role-ec2_instance-profiles.html).
# How to use this project
usage: |-
  This example will create an IAM user and allow read access to all objects in the S3 bucket `examplebucket`


  ```hcl
  module "s3_user" {
    source       = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-iam-s3-user.git?ref=master"
    namespace    = "eg"
    stage        = "test"
    name         = "app"
    s3_actions   = ["s3:GetObject"]
    s3_resources = "arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/*"
  }
  ```
